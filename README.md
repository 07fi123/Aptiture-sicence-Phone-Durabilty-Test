#### What I learned.

Spent some time googling and fishing around in the documentation to try to understand how to get liner velocity and position values from the sensors. Took a bit to get the values right and I wonder if the data coming off the sensors is  different device to device because I found that I was getting strange values when I normalized for the nanosecond timestamps I was supposed to be getting from the hardware (I would wager that it's not that precise). I also made a cute promo video that I was going to display in device using a video player. I didn't have time to get that working well enough to have it turned on. The remnants of this are in the code and the file is in the repo. Could have been cooler but I still think it's fairly cool to get data from the sensors like this.
